Part 1. Localisation.
  Mainly, localiation works with two parts. The first part is the motion part, where we keep track of the robot's position and orientation so that we know where the robot is in respect to the initial position. The initial positon is unknown since we are trying a complete SLAM, where the initial position is not provided.
